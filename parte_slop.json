Certainly not. But this one has a legacy that laid dormant for 16 years: The 19th century landmark reopened in 2021 after a $900 million restoration by LVMH, and swapped the utilitarian focus for one decidedly more upscale. Locals used to shop here for everything from light bulbs and garden supplies to dresses, but now it's a gallery of sorts for designer clothes, beauty brands, and a handful of food and Champagne concept spaces throughout the shop. But it's an Art Deco and Art Nouveau wonder which is the primary reason to visit. Approximately 215,000 square feet are devoted to retail space in this complex, which includes the Cheval Blanc hotel, office space, and housing, making it the smallest of the city’s department stores (the others are Le Bon Marché, Printemps, and Galeries Lafayette). The spaces it does occupy covers the usual terrain: streetwear and luxury ready-to-wear which includes pieces exclusive to La Samaritaine, clean beauty and classic perfumers, handbags and fine jewelry, and several rooms used for rotating thematic installations.Located in the heart of the Sixth Arrondissement, the famous Jardin du Luxembourg is an inviting green oasis for Parisians and visitors alike.

Don't freak out, but walking through the halls where Louis XIV once strolled (he lived here before moving to Versailles), surrounded by the most famous art on earth can be an overwhelming experience. What’s more, there are some 35,000 artworks and artifacts from prehistory to the 21st century housed within its walls. As a result, it could take a lifetime to see and experience it all so don’t try (the museum sells multi-day passes so you can spread out your visit).

But it’s also a great way to skip the line or wait in a shorter line at the Eiffel Tower. If you choose to take the stairs, you can also purchase an elevator ticket to reach the top floor.Plan your visit with our Guide to the Eiffel Tower, which explains your ticket options, how to avoid a long wait in line, and several unique dining experiences on the Eiffel Tower.",

Remember that races start early—between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.—and that commentary and announcements are made in Arabic.",
  "New York": "New York City is a whirlwind of excitement! Start with the iconic Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to dive into American history. Then, catch the dazzling views from the Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, soaking in the city's skyline. Walk through Central Park, a serene oasis in the middle of skyscrapers, perfect for picnics and people-watching. Explore Times Square's bustling energy, Broadway theaters, and neon lights. Don't miss the cultural diversity and delicious food in neighborhoods like Chinatown, Little Italy, and Harlem. Visit world-class museums like the MET and MoMA for incredible art collections. Take a stroll along the High Line, a unique park built on an old railway line, offering great views of the city. And of course, New York's events are legendary, with concerts, parades, and festivals happening year-round!One of the most mysterious things about New York City is that the closer you look—even at something as minor as a street corner—the more you see. And the longer you look, the faster it changes before your eyes. People can live here for 100 years and never run out of places to go or people to meet, so deciding the best things to do in New York is daunting; which is why we're narrowing your options. Whether you're a local itching to get out of your neighborhood or an out-of-towner who doesn't know The Met from the Mets, these new and classic activities alike will dazzle you. From wandering Central Park to slurping soup dumplings in Chinatown, these are a few of our very favorite things to do in New York City, from Midtown to Brooklyn.To get that Nora Ephron New York experience, you have no choice but to take a stroll through Central Park while in the city. As you step off the crowded sidewalks of 59th Street into a mass of green, you’ll hardly realize what lies before you: 693 acres of man-made gardens, meadows, forests, and  hillsides. If you ambled down every one of Central Park’s pathways, you would walk 58 miles. Along the way, you pass sculptures, bridges, and arches, plus 21 playgrounds, a winter ice-skating rink, even a zoo . But you’d hardly notice the four major crosstown thoroughfares, which cleverly disappear into foliage-covered tunnels. Map your park route to stop at classic Central Park landmarks, like the Bethesda Fountain, Bow Bridge, Belvedere Castle, and the Strawberry Fields John Lennon Memorial.Chinatown is one of the neighborhoods that makes lower Manhattan vibrant and unforgettable. After surfacing from the steps of the Canal Street subway station onto the sidewalk, meandering past thick crowds, neon light shops, and vendors peddling fake designer bags, you’ll find yourself in the narrow streets of Chinatown, where there are bright heaps of produce, succulent ducks hanging in windows, and restaurants old and new. Touching Tribeca, SoHo, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side, Chinatown has a rich history and began being populated by Chinese immigrants as early as the 1850s. You can visit in whichever way makes sense for you. Whether you spend an hour devouring a box of roast pork or duck from street-style Wah Fung No. 1 before you have to proceed elsewhere, or you spend half a day shopping for produce, dining out, and paying a visit to the Museum of Chinese in America, everyone will gain something from a visit to Chinatown.The Whitney got a major upgrade when it relocated from the Upper East Side to its vastly-expanded Meatpacking headquarters in 2015. It houses 50,000 square feet of indoor galleries with works by Jean Michel Basquiat, Richard Avedon, and Alexander Calder, four outdoor exhibition spaces and terraces, and a ground-floor restaurant and top-floor bar, both by Danny Meyer, one of the town’s best-known restaurateurs. The floors are connected by two artist-designed elevators (albeit slow-moving, crowded ones). If mobility isn’t an issue, take the stairs instead, which offer uninterrupted views of the Hudson river. The upper floors and sculpture terraces are also connected by a series of exterior staircases, with great views of the downtown skyline, and a rare opportunity to experience art en plein aire.A spring or summer day spent cheering at an NYC ballpark is a classic activity for a reason. Located in the Bronx, Yankee Stadium is the home field of New York’s 27-time World Champions. It’s a half-hour subway ride from Penn Station and approximately a 20-minute subway ride from Grand Central Terminal, making it easily accessible from Manhattan. It replaced the 1923 original in 2009 and cost $1.5 billion to build, making it one of the world’s most expensive stadiums. It seats 50,287 fans. New York Yankees games, obviously, are the main event here, but you can also attend concerts, college football, and soccer matches.The Morgan is like a multi-hyphenate millennial—only instead of actress/model/influencer/whatever, it’s museum/library/landmark/historic site/music venue. Inside the multimillionaire’s personal library, expanded into a must-see museum and cultural space, you'll find rare artifacts, paintings, and books, some dating back to 4000 B.C. that are worth more than your house. In particular the museum is home to one of 23 copies of the original Declaration of Independence; Mozart's handwritten score of the Haffner Symphony; the collected works of African American poet Phillis Wheatley; the only extant manuscript of Milton's Paradise Lost; and Charles Dickens’s manuscript of A Christmas Carol. Swoon.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine on 112th and Amsterdam in Upper Manhattan’s Morningside Heights is the largest cathedral in the world and the sixth-largest church by area. Hundreds of thousands of visitors walk through these doors annually for a reason. The cathedral itself—and its remarkable Gothic architecture, story-telling stained glass windows, and 17th century tapestries—is already worth visiting. But there is artwork that is especially meaningful to New York City here as well, including Keith Haring's white gold and bronze altarpiece and a 9/11 memorial sculpture by Meredith Bergmann, which holds debris of the towers in it.  The cathedral holds daily and Sunday worship services, which welcome all. There is no charge to pray, meditate, or contemplate in the cathedral. Visitors who show for sightseeing purposes can enter for $5 admission. Special tours are offered depending on the day of the week. ",
  "Singapore": "Singapore is a vibrant blend of modernity and culture! Begin your journey by visiting Gardens by the Bay, where futuristic supertrees and stunning gardens create a mesmerizing sight.

Since the pandemic, most of the attractions have reopened safely, adhering to Singapore’s safe management measures and SG Clean certification guidelines. Read on for our picks of the best things to do in Singapore.This is a hugely popular tourist attraction in Singapore, and rightly so. The breadth of plants and the creative ways in which they're displayed is awe-inspiring. In one part of the conservatory, the Cloud Forest mimics the cool-moist ecology of the tropical highlands. It has a treetop walk and an oft-photographed indoor 114-foot waterfall. With more than 9,000 works, National Gallery Singapore owns the largest public collection of modern art in Southeast Asia. It's spread across two beautiful national monuments: City Hall and the country’s former Supreme Court. Some visitors spend half a day (or more) wandering the museum’s many galleries. If you're looking to avoid lines, consider going on a weekday and buying your tickets in advance online.Are you a hipster? Or a devout Muslim? Do you like unconventional modern art or traditional Arab crafts? Do you just want that Instagram snap or are you interested in learning more about this historic district, from its red-light leanings to its religious importance? Or maybe you just want a slice of the delicious kaya swiss roll from the famous Rich & Good Cake Shop? If you answered yes to any of these things, this delightfully eclectic enclave is for you. Singapore's Muslim quarter dates back to the 1800s, but the area has grown and changed, blending the religious and historical with a modern take on the city-state.It might seem odd to tell travelers to hang out in an airport, but Jewel Changi is no ordinary airport (it's a fixture at the top of our Readers' Choice Awards best airport list). The transportation hub is also a nature-themed shopping, dining, and entertainment extravaganza designed by architect Moshe Safdie. The project's highlights include the Rain Vortex, a seven-story-tall indoor waterfall; an indoor forest with suspended walkways; and nearly 300 stores. This is a game-changer for travelers on layovers. It's so popular (and so worth it) that 20 airlines will let you check in a full 24 hours in advance just to maximize your time inside.The Intan is a private home that houses one of Singapore’s most impressive collections of Peranakan artifacts. Owner Alvin Yapp has spent 30-plus years collecting 1,500 objects from Peranakan culture, most notably kasut manek (ornate beaded slippers worn by Straits Chinese women) and enamel tiffin carriers hand-painted in delicate floral patterns. Yapp's post-war home is a labor of love, and it shows in the meticulous way that he has arranged every square inch of it. Visits are strictly by appointment only.This island was once known for its granite quarries. But when they closed down in the 1970s and jobs dwindled, residents began leaving. Today, the island is home to fewer than 50 people, who have chosen to stay for the old way of life. Which is exactly what people like visiting it for, too. Stepping onto Pulau Ubin is like time-traveling to the way Singapore was decades ago. Even getting to it is old-fashioned: You take a 10-minute ride on a chugging bumboat from Changi Point Ferry Terminal. This is a rich experience even for those who are cash-poor, and the perfect day trip for those looking to see a different time in Singapore's history or experience its wild side.This promenade overlooking Marina Bay is home to Singapore's iconic 28-foot Merlion statue, a half-fish, half-lion stone carving that shoots water into the bay. The fish symbolizes Singapore's beginnings as a fishing village while the lion head is a nod to Singapura, which means Lion City in Malay. Erected in 1972, it remains one of the nation's most popular tourist attractions, so plan accordingly.This one's for ballers: If you have cash to splash, you can do everything from have a meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant to check out the view from the SkyPark. The massive Moshe Safdie-designed mall, casino, convention center, and hotel is perhaps Singapore's most iconic building. A must-visit is the ArtScience Museum, Singapore's most future-forward, and the 57-story-high SkyPark, Singapore's best.Forget manicured or wild, this eight-acre outdoor art park is bizarre but a feast for the eyes. It was set up in the 1930s—before the advent of TV and the Internet—by Tiger Balm founder and philanthropist Aw Boon Haw, who commissioned more than 1,000 detailed sculptures and dioramas that would teach traditional Chinese values. Back then, it was popular and crowded, but has become less so over the years. And though it's lost a bit of its luster, that only lends to its charm and 'raw' feel—what you get here is an unfiltered, in-your-face lesson on Chinese morals and culture that doesn't sit behind velvet ropes or glass panels, and isn't crawling with tourists. Also of note: This Asian cultural park claims to be the last of its kind in the world, though it's hard to imagine there were many like this to begin with. ",
  "Kuala Lumpur": "Kuala Lumpur, the vibrant capital of Malaysia, is a melting pot of culture and modernity!

There's absolutely no doubt about it.Spanning two peninsulas and an impressive archipelago of islands offering lush rainforest, undulating tea country and sandy beaches, this tropical Southeast Asian nation is often neglected in favour of neighbouring Thailand and Indonesia. Be wary of making that same mistake: Malaysia should be firmly at the top of every discerning traveller’s bucket list, and with its humid climate year-round, it is a no-brainer destination for a slice of winter sun. A stopover in the capital is a natural starting point for your explorations. From marvelling at local wildlife to sampling the tastiest street food at the world-famous night markets, we’ve rounded up the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur below.Indisputably the most recognisable landmark in the capital, the Petronas Towers are the tallest twin towers in the world, pricking Kuala Lumpur’s hazy skyline with their identical silver prongs – at one point, they were also recognised as the tallest building in the world. Nab tickets to the Observation Deck on the 86th floor for sweeping views across the city before heading downstairs to the thriving shopping mall beneath, which houses everything from a slew of stylish designer boutiques to a bustling food court, cinema, and aquarium.The bedrock of Malaysian cuisine is its street food, with mainstay dishes best tasted fresh from the hawker stalls and guaranteed to wow with aromatic flavours. A visit to one of Kuala Lumpur’s famous street-food markets is the ultimate initiation to Malaysian culture, with entire evenings easily spent sampling the variety of goods on offer. Visit Jalan Alor, a massive thoroughfare dedicated to street-food stalls, forming a river of vendors to wade through, where you can sample everything from nasi lemak (commonly known as a breakfast dish but now served round the clock) to spicy, slippery laksa, and curries mopped up with flaky roti canai. Meanwhile, famous Petaling Street, located in the heart of Chinatown, also comes alive in the evening, where you can taste delicacies from some of the oldest street-food stalls in the city, each of which has cultivated a loyal fan base.A melting pot of different ethnicities and cultural groups, Malaysia’s history is peppered with various periods of European rule, having once been colonised by the British, Portuguese, and Dutch. Remnants of these periods are still visible throughout the capital, with the remains of colonial buildings often spotted nestled between glossy skyscrapers and modern new buildings. The Old Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, often recognised as one of the most beautiful railway stations in the world, is a prime example of colonial rule. Simply gazing at it is one of the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur, but it also provides the ultimate Instagram fodder.

Here's how to enjoy this exciting city to the fullest.1. Admire the city's modern architecture.Astana's architecture is an eclectic jumble of Eastern and Western styles, and though it draws inspiration from diverse cultural traditions much of the city is relatively new. In 1998, renowned Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa was tasked with creating a master plan for the capital, incorporating elements of the existing settlement to form a dynamic, design-led space.

Look to the future at the Nur Alem museum.Unlike most museums, which focus firmly on the past, Nur Alem Future Energy Museum offers a glimpse into the future.

Appreciate some musical masterpieces.Few occasions carry the same connotations of elegance and grandeur as a night at the opera, and Astana is the perfect place to dip your toes into the world of classical music.

Marvel at the largest mosque in Central Asia.With a capacity of 235,000 people, Astana Grand Mosque’s scale alone is impressive enough, but it's the beauty of its interiors that really capture the imagination.

The first event, with chef Artem Evstafev, took place in June and six events are scheduled to follow in the second half of the year.7. Discover Kazakhstan's national treasure.When in Astana, a visit to the National Museum is a must. With 18 halls spanning chronologically from the Bronze Age to the modern day, it's an accessible introduction to the rich culture and history of Kazakhstan. Perhaps the most impressive of the myriad displays is the Hall of Gold, filled with glittering treasure and guarded by a life-size figurine known as the Golden Man, adorned in the gilded clothing of a fierce warrior from the nomadic Saka people, who lived in Kazakhstan between the eighth and third century BC.8. Enjoy the buzzy nightlife.Astana's nightlife really comes into its own at the weekend, with numerous bustling bars and clubs to choose from.

It's home to the most northerly nest of pink flamingos in the world, which – between April and September – you'll see striding through these marshy wetlands. They're joined by more than 300 other species of bird, from Dalmatian pelicans, with their distinctive curly neck feathers, enormous cormorants, gangly long-legged storks and herons gracefully diving for fish.10. Take a weekend getaway to the mountains.A three-hour drive from Astana's city centre, Burabay National Park is known as the Switzerland of Kazakhstan or the Pearl of the Great Steppe for its rare, luminous beauty. A mysterious landscape of dramatic slopes forested with mighty pines, it's the site of countless legends including tales of dancing maidens turned into intertwined birch trees and a magical white camel.

The Azerbaijani capital is certainly the architectural and developmental wonder of the region, with tons of futuristic building projects on par with Dubai. A few years ago, they even joined the ranks of cities hosting prestigious Formula One races.Despite its rapid growth and development, the city never forgot where it came from.

  "Maputo": "It’s no secret that Maputo has a great party scene.  In fact, it seemed like most of the Swazis on the bus from Swaziland to Maputo seemed to be going there to party for the weekend. All the Mozambicans I spoke to seemed to agree that partying was at the top of their lists of favorite things to do in Maputo.The Mozambicans found ways to party everywhere. On the beach, in the streets, in the afternoon at a restaurant…nowhere was off limits. Live music and dancing are easy to find. Dive in an have fun!I confess that I love trains. I was brainwashed as a child because my father is an avid rail fan. But even if you think trains are “just ok” you will love the Maputo Train Station.From it’s beautiful green color to the unique architecture, the railway station no only stands out as a must do among things to do in Maputo, but it also stands out as one of the most interesting buildings in the entire country.Be sure to check out my other Mozambique tips and posts here!In addition to enjoying the building itself, you can explore the market surrounding the station as well as the trains coming and going from the inside. It was cool to peek inside the variety of train cars and people watch in the station.There is also a small museum in the back of the station that may bore the average visitor, but I guarantee that any train enthusiast will be in heaven.I had a crazy train adventure from Maputo to Zimbabwe. Check it out!I’m biased because I love trains, but I think this may be my favorite on the list of things to do in Maputo.Maputo’s Fish Market recently moved to a new, modern building. It is right along the beach and easy to reach by chapa if you ask around for the correct one.You can stroll around and look at the fresh fish for sale. You may get squirted with water by the little shellfish!  Lots of vendors will be vying for your attention so get ready!You can also go right outside and eat at one of the many restaurants there. All the servers will run up to you and try to get you to go to their place. Even my local friend felt overwhelmed! The restaurants all have basically the same menu and seating arrangement. It’s hard to even distinguish what tables belong to what restaurants.The prices were a little high, which is expected for such a tourist draw. The portions were big and the food was pretty good. We got a big plate of grilled prawns and a plate of rice.It was nice to enjoy the ocean breeze, and the place fills up with a really diverse group of people -think a table of Chinese businessmen sitting next to a table of teenaged Mormon missionaries. Although it was good for people-watching, I probably wouldn’t go back to those restaurants.4. The Fortress (Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Conceicao)There’s a small museum with some artifacts relating to the colonial history of the country, but I thought it also did a good job of depicting Mozambican culture independent of its history with the Portuguese. There seems to be rotating exhibitions that display work made by local artists.This big fortress in the center of Maputo was built by the Portuguese colonists and dates back to 1787. There are lots of cannons in it that were interesting to see. It’s a quick visit, and maybe you will spend 40 minutes maximum there.5. The Natural History Museum (Museu de História Natural)I had some strange realizations in this museum.But let’s back up for a second. The outside of the museum looks like it is straight out of Portugal. That was interesting…But once you’re inside…well…let’s just say my first reaction was “yikes…”It’s an enormous collection of [questionably done] taxidermy.  Dozens of lions, several elephants, Pangolins-those poor pangolins! Lots of Pangolins. They even have an exhibit showing the development of elephant fetuses…using real elephant fetuses.Most of the animals on display are relics of the Portuguese rule. Some are over 100 years old, but that still made me feel pretty…icky.My Mozambican friend was genuinely excited to be there and see the taxidermy. He was proud of his city and its museums. I shut up. He didn’t need a cynical millennial raining on his parade.The horns on the stuffed rhinos in the museum are fake. The real horns were stolen. Sigh to stuffed rhinos, and double sigh to stealing horns off of stuffed rhinos.Animals aside, the Natural History Museum of Maputo also had an interesting collection of tribal artifacts. I especially loved seeing the variety of musical instruments they had on display! That was the best part of the museum.Lastly, they have a questionably preserved Coelacanth. I had to mention that because I’m pretty much obsessed with coelacanths.I wouldn’t put this museum on the top of my list of things to do in Maputo, but it’s still on the list just because it was such a strange place to visit.6. The Beach.That’s actually a photo of Tofo Beach. I didn’t bring my camera to the beach in Maputo!There’s a ton of beachfront. You can go take a walk on it after the Fish Market, or you can make a day of it like I did. Going to the beach is definitely one of the best things to do in Maputo.I went to the  Praia da Costa do Sol (Sunshine Coast)  on a different day and it was a good time with some friends. It was a holiday and there were tons of food stands, impromptu capoeira, and just tons of people everywhere. It was fun to hang out in a group and meet new people, but it wasn’t the kind of beach where I would want to go to alone and fall asleep.7. Núcleo De Arte.This is THE place to visit if you want to experience the local arts culture in Maputo. There’s a gallery and plenty of studios/workshops where you can see local artists at work. I loved talking to the artists as they were working on their pieces or projects. There’s also a bar/café and so the place comes alive at night!The best thing in Maputo is the people.Sure, sure…I get it. Cheesy. But really!  Mozambicans are so warm and welcoming. They even have a saying, “Here in Mozambique, we like to help you out!” It’s so true.You’ll get up close and personal with plenty of Mozambicans if you travel around in the local chapas!Have you been to Maputo?
