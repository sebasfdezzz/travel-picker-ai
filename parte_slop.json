Certainly not. But this one has a legacy that laid dormant for 16 years: The 19th century landmark reopened in 2021 after a $900 million restoration by LVMH, and swapped the utilitarian focus for one decidedly more upscale. Locals used to shop here for everything from light bulbs and garden supplies to dresses, but now it's a gallery of sorts for designer clothes, beauty brands, and a handful of food and Champagne concept spaces throughout the shop. But it's an Art Deco and Art Nouveau wonder which is the primary reason to visit. Approximately 215,000 square feet are devoted to retail space in this complex, which includes the Cheval Blanc hotel, office space, and housing, making it the smallest of the city’s department stores (the others are Le Bon Marché, Printemps, and Galeries Lafayette). The spaces it does occupy covers the usual terrain: streetwear and luxury ready-to-wear which includes pieces exclusive to La Samaritaine, clean beauty and classic perfumers, handbags and fine jewelry, and several rooms used for rotating thematic installations.Located in the heart of the Sixth Arrondissement, the famous Jardin du Luxembourg is an inviting green oasis for Parisians and visitors alike.

What’s more, there are some 35,000 artworks and artifacts from prehistory to the 21st century housed within its walls. As a result, it could take a lifetime to see and experience it all so don’t try (the museum sells multi-day passes so you can spread out your visit).

  "New York": "New York City is a whirlwind of excitement! Start with the iconic Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to dive into American history. Then, catch the dazzling views from the Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, soaking in the city's skyline. Walk through Central Park, a serene oasis in the middle of skyscrapers, perfect for picnics and people-watching. Explore Times Square's bustling energy, Broadway theaters, and neon lights. Don't miss the cultural diversity and delicious food in neighborhoods like Chinatown, Little Italy, and Harlem. Visit world-class museums like the MET and MoMA for incredible art collections. Take a stroll along the High Line, a unique park built on an old railway line, offering great views of the city. And of course, New York's events are legendary, with concerts, parades, and festivals happening year-round!One of the most mysterious things about New York City is that the closer you look—even at something as minor as a street corner—the more you see. And the longer you look, the faster it changes before your eyes. People can live here for 100 years and never run out of places to go or people to meet, so deciding the best things to do in New York is daunting; which is why we're narrowing your options. Whether you're a local itching to get out of your neighborhood or an out-of-towner who doesn't know The Met from the Mets, these new and classic activities alike will dazzle you. From wandering Central Park to slurping soup dumplings in Chinatown, these are a few of our very favorite things to do in New York City, from Midtown to Brooklyn.To get that Nora Ephron New York experience, you have no choice but to take a stroll through Central Park while in the city. As you step off the crowded sidewalks of 59th Street into a mass of green, you’ll hardly realize what lies before you: 693 acres of man-made gardens, meadows, forests, and  hillsides. If you ambled down every one of Central Park’s pathways, you would walk 58 miles. Along the way, you pass sculptures, bridges, and arches, plus 21 playgrounds, a winter ice-skating rink, even a zoo . But you’d hardly notice the four major crosstown thoroughfares, which cleverly disappear into foliage-covered tunnels. Map your park route to stop at classic Central Park landmarks, like the Bethesda Fountain, Bow Bridge, Belvedere Castle, and the Strawberry Fields John Lennon Memorial.Chinatown is one of the neighborhoods that makes lower Manhattan vibrant and unforgettable. After surfacing from the steps of the Canal Street subway station onto the sidewalk, meandering past thick crowds, neon light shops, and vendors peddling fake designer bags, you’ll find yourself in the narrow streets of Chinatown, where there are bright heaps of produce, succulent ducks hanging in windows, and restaurants old and new. Touching Tribeca, SoHo, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side, Chinatown has a rich history and began being populated by Chinese immigrants as early as the 1850s. You can visit in whichever way makes sense for you. Whether you spend an hour devouring a box of roast pork or duck from street-style Wah Fung No. 1 before you have to proceed elsewhere, or you spend half a day shopping for produce, dining out, and paying a visit to the Museum of Chinese in America, everyone will gain something from a visit to Chinatown.The Whitney got a major upgrade when it relocated from the Upper East Side to its vastly-expanded Meatpacking headquarters in 2015. It houses 50,000 square feet of indoor galleries with works by Jean Michel Basquiat, Richard Avedon, and Alexander Calder, four outdoor exhibition spaces and terraces, and a ground-floor restaurant and top-floor bar, both by Danny Meyer, one of the town’s best-known restaurateurs. The floors are connected by two artist-designed elevators (albeit slow-moving, crowded ones). If mobility isn’t an issue, take the stairs instead, which offer uninterrupted views of the Hudson river. The upper floors and sculpture terraces are also connected by a series of exterior staircases, with great views of the downtown skyline, and a rare opportunity to experience art en plein aire.A spring or summer day spent cheering at an NYC ballpark is a classic activity for a reason. Located in the Bronx, Yankee Stadium is the home field of New York’s 27-time World Champions. It’s a half-hour subway ride from Penn Station and approximately a 20-minute subway ride from Grand Central Terminal, making it easily accessible from Manhattan. It replaced the 1923 original in 2009 and cost $1.5 billion to build, making it one of the world’s most expensive stadiums. It seats 50,287 fans. New York Yankees games, obviously, are the main event here, but you can also attend concerts, college football, and soccer matches.The Morgan is like a multi-hyphenate millennial—only instead of actress/model/influencer/whatever, it’s museum/library/landmark/historic site/music venue. Inside the multimillionaire’s personal library, expanded into a must-see museum and cultural space, you'll find rare artifacts, paintings, and books, some dating back to 4000 B.C. that are worth more than your house.

Swoon.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine on 112th and Amsterdam in Upper Manhattan’s Morningside Heights is the largest cathedral in the world and the sixth-largest church by area. Hundreds of thousands of visitors walk through these doors annually for a reason. The cathedral itself—and its remarkable Gothic architecture, story-telling stained glass windows, and 17th century tapestries—is already worth visiting. But there is artwork that is especially meaningful to New York City here as well, including Keith Haring's white gold and bronze altarpiece and a 9/11 memorial sculpture by Meredith Bergmann, which holds debris of the towers in it.  The cathedral holds daily and Sunday worship services, which welcome all. There is no charge to pray, meditate, or contemplate in the cathedral. Visitors who show for sightseeing purposes can enter for $5 admission. Special tours are offered depending on the day of the week. ",

The project's highlights include the Rain Vortex, a seven-story-tall indoor waterfall; an indoor forest with suspended walkways; and nearly 300 stores.

It's so popular (and so worth it) that 20 airlines will let you check in a full 24 hours in advance just to maximize your time inside.The Intan is a private home that houses one of Singapore’s most impressive collections of Peranakan artifacts.

Yapp's post-war home is a labor of love, and it shows in the meticulous way that he has arranged every square inch of it. Visits are strictly by appointment only.This island was once known for its granite quarries. But when they closed down in the 1970s and jobs dwindled, residents began leaving. Today, the island is home to fewer than 50 people, who have chosen to stay for the old way of life. Which is exactly what people like visiting it for, too. Stepping onto Pulau Ubin is like time-traveling to the way Singapore was decades ago. Even getting to it is old-fashioned: You take a 10-minute ride on a chugging bumboat from Changi Point Ferry Terminal. This is a rich experience even for those who are cash-poor, and the perfect day trip for those looking to see a different time in Singapore's history or experience its wild side.This promenade overlooking Marina Bay is home to Singapore's iconic 28-foot Merlion statue, a half-fish, half-lion stone carving that shoots water into the bay.

A must-visit is the ArtScience Museum, Singapore's most future-forward, and the 57-story-high SkyPark, Singapore's best.Forget manicured or wild, this eight-acre outdoor art park is bizarre but a feast for the eyes. It was set up in the 1930s—before the advent of TV and the Internet—by Tiger Balm founder and philanthropist Aw Boon Haw, who commissioned more than 1,000 detailed sculptures and dioramas that would teach traditional Chinese values. Back then, it was popular and crowded, but has become less so over the years. And though it's lost a bit of its luster, that only lends to its charm and 'raw' feel—what you get here is an unfiltered, in-your-face lesson on Chinese morals and culture that doesn't sit behind velvet ropes or glass panels, and isn't crawling with tourists. Also of note: This Asian cultural park claims to be the last of its kind in the world, though it's hard to imagine there were many like this to begin with. ",
